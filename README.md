## Features

A user must be able to register and/or log in (depending on the API's capabilities).
A user must be able to manage the main resources of the API's domain model:
A user must be able to create new instances of all the main resources of the domain model (e.g. create Trips and Places in the Travel Log).

A user must be able to modify at least one of the resources of the domain model (e.g. update a Trip's title and description in the Travel Log).

A user must be able to delete at least one of the resources of the domain model (e.g. delete a Place in the Travel Log).

At least two mobile-oriented features must be used, for example:
Geolocation of the user (e.g. to center a map on the user's location, or to determine a Place's location in the Travel log).

Pictures taken with the phone's camera (works only on physical devices). You are not required to exclusively implement those two ; you can choose others depending on your subject
There must be a map showing geolocated resources (with more than one item on the same map).

There must be a resource list with filters or search parameters.

## Implementation

The app must follow Angular and Ionic best practices.
The app must use an approved API.
Asynchronous code must be correctly handled (e.g. callbacks, promises and/or observables).
The app must provide clear feedback when errors are likely to occur:
When submitting a form (input might be invalid or the API call might fail).
When geolocating the user (it might fail).
Secrets (passwords & keys) must not be committed to the Git repository.
## Presentation

You must provide a presentation for your app. This can be either in the form of a user guide or in the form of a pitch as if it were a real app that you were going to sell. You can choose from the following options (one is enough):

You can present the app in the README or the Wiki of the GitHub repository for the app.
You can make a webcast/video demonstrating or selling your app.
You can provide a tutorial inside the app.
You can use any other presentation tool (subject to approval) but your user guide or pitch must be available online.
You can upload your app to a store (e.g. Google Play), and write the store page as you would for a real app. This last one is kind of tough, and doing it will not get you a better grade. You've been warned
## Delivery
Each group must send an e-mail no later than 21th of january 2020 to Mathias Oberson with:

- The list of group members.
- The link to your source code repository on GitHub.
- The link to your webcast, presentation page or user guide (if it's not in the repository).
